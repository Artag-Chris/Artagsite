## 🎬 Content Pillars (Simplified)

| Priority | Pillar | What to Post | How Often | Why |
|----------|--------|--------------|-----------|-----|
| 1 | Animation Breakdowns | "Here's why X is better than Y" | 1x/week | Showcases your expertise, helps viewers |
| 2 | Building in Public | Debug sessions, iterations, process | 1x/week | Builds trust, shows you're real |
| 3 | Tech Deep Dives | Framer Motion, Next.js, TypeScript | 2x/week | Positions you as specialist |
| 4 | Value Insights | Why animations cost money, mistakes | 2x/month | Bridges tech and business understanding |
| 5 | Social Proof | Project spotlights, testimonials | 2x/month | Subtle promotion, shows results |

---

## 📱 Weekly Template (Copy This)

```
MONDAY 8am → Post Animation Breakdown Reel
WEDNESDAY 12pm → Post Tech Deep Dive Carousel
FRIDAY 8am → Post Building in Public Reel

DAILY → Spend 15 minutes engaging (comment, like, reply)
```

**That's 3 posts/week minimum. Takes ~2-3 hours total.**

---

## 🚀 Expected Results

- **Month 1:** 300-500 new followers (you're testing)
- **Month 3:** 1500-2000 followers (gaining momentum)
- **Month 6:** 4000-5000 followers (recognized expertise)
- **Month 12:** 8000-10000+ followers (destination account)

**Real outcome:** 2-3 quality inbound leads per month from Instagram alone (by month 3).

## ⚡ Key Principles

1. **Consistency > Perfection**
   - Post regularly, even if not perfect
   - Algorithm favors consistency
   - Your best post ever is worth nothing if you don't post again

2. **Educational > Salesy**
   - Teach something useful in every post
   - Let the teaching do the selling
   - "Hey, hire me" never works on Instagram

3. **Show Process > Show Results**
   - People connect with process
   - Showing results looks like bragging
   - Showing how you solve problems builds trust

4. **Engagement > Reach**
   - Respond to every comment
   - Ask questions in captions
   - Build a community, not an audience

5. **Quality Over Quantity**
   - 3 excellent posts > 7 mediocre posts
   - Focus on depth, not speed
   - Your audience wants to learn, not be entertained

## 🎁 Bonus: Why This Works for You

Most developers try to "show" their portfolio on Instagram. That doesn't work.

**What works:** Teaching what you know.

When you teach:
- People learn something real
- They remember you positively
- They trust you know your stuff
- When they need a developer, you're top-of-mind
- They're pre-sold before any conversation

This strategy does exactly that.

**Start this week. Post consistently. Build a community.**

That's the entire strategy.

Good luck! 🚀
