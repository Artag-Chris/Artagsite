## ⚠️ Common Mistakes (Avoid These)

❌ Posting less than 2x/week (algorithm penalty)
❌ Using 30 random hashtags (looks spammy)
❌ "Like and follow for more!" (Instagram kills reach)
❌ Not engaging with comments (kills community)
❌ Switching styles every week (confuses audience)
❌ Only showing finished work (people don't connect with results)
❌ Long captions with no breaks (mobile readers skip)
