```
MONDAY    → Pillar #1: Animation Breakdown Reel (30-45 sec)
WEDNESDAY → Pillar #1 or #3: Scroll Animation or Tech Deep Dive (Carousel)

## 🎬 Reel Formula (30-45 seconds)

**Structure:**
1. **Hook** (0-3 sec) - Problem statement or surprising fact
2. **Explanation** (3-20 sec) - Show the solution/concept
3. **Example** (20-40 sec) - Real demonstration or code
4. **CTA** (40-45 sec) - "Save this," "Try it," "Comment your experience"

**Example:**
- "Your animation feels off. Here's why" (hook)
- "Animating width breaks performance" (problem)
- Show code + result (visual proof)
- "Drop a 🎬 if you've made this mistake" (engagement)

---

## 📸 Carousel Formula (5-7 slides)

**Structure:**
1. **Hook Slide** - Question or bold statement
2. **Problem Slide** - What's wrong/why it matters
3. **Solution Slide #1** - First part of answer
4. **Solution Slide #2** - Second part with code/visual
5. **Example Slide** - Real-world application
6. **Result Slide** - Why it matters
7. **CTA Slide** - "Save," "Share," or "Link in bio"

---

## 🎨 Visual Branding (Consistency = Growth)

**Color Palette:**
- Primary gradient: Emerald → Teal → Cyan → Indigo → Violet
- Accent: Orange/Amber
- Background: Dark (capitalize on dark mode expertise)

**Design Elements:**
- Glow effects (your signature)
- Geometric shapes
- Code snippets in consistent blocks
- Minimalist whitespace

---

## #️⃣ Hashtag Strategy

**Always use these (your brand):**
```
#ArtagDev #FullStackDeveloper #WebAnimations
```

**Use 5-8 per post (your niche):**
```
#FramerMotion #GSAP #ReactAnimations #WebDeveloper
#NextJS #TypeScript #InteractiveDesign #FrontendDeveloper
```

**Add 4-6 reach hashtags:**
```
#WebDevelopment #CodeLife #DeveloperPortfolio #Programming
#DesignDeveloper #CreativeCoding
```

**Total: 15-20 hashtags per post**

- ❌ "Like and follow for more!" (Instagram penalizes this)
- ❌ Only engaging with your own posts (no community)
