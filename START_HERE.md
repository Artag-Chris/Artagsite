## 🔥 The Reality Check

**This is not** a get-rich-quick scheme.

**This IS:**
- 2-3 hours/week of consistent work
- 6 months until real results
- Educational content that builds trust
- A way to pre-sell yourself before conversations

**Will it work?** 
Yes. If you post consistently, engage genuinely, and teach what you know.

The Instagram algorithm rewards consistency above all else.

## 💡 Key Principles

   Post regularly, even if not perfect.

   Teach first. Let the teaching do the selling.

3. **Process > Results**
   Show how you solve problems, not just finished work.

4. **Engagement > Reach**
   Reply to every comment. Build community.
